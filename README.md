# ‚ú® AI GitHub Copilot VS Code Chat Modes

- Founder: [Abdullah Khawer - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-khawer)

# Introduction

A curated collection of custom chat modes based on `chatmode.md` files for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) used by GitHub Copilot to enhance your development using AI to work smarter.

Custom chat modes allow you to modify GitHub Copilot's behavior in VS Code. Each `chatMode.md` file builds a specialized AI assistant with targeted knowledge and abilities for your development work, significantly cutting development time by eliminating repetitive manual tasks.

## Official Documentation

- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)
- [Custom Chat Modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes#_custom-chat-modes)

## Getting Started

To use any of these custom chat modes:

1. Copy the desired `.chatmode.md` file from the `/chat-modes` directory in this repository to your workspace's `.github/chatmodes` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Restart VS Code to load the new chat mode.
3. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat panel in VS Code.
4. Click the dropdown menu at the bottom of the chat panel and select your custom chat mode from the list.

The chat mode will now be active, and Copilot Chat will respond according to the instructions defined in the chosen `.chatmode.md` file.
